# Aircraft Safety Analysis

**Author**: [Matt LeRoi](mailto:mcleroi@gmail.com) 

# Business Understanding

The goal of this project is to assess the accident risk of small aircraft for business/private use. The client is new to the business of operating aircraft and wants to minimize risk. This also includes focusing on the most common aircraft and newer planes to reduce the number of unknowns that would arise from lesser-used aircraft and the potential for incomplete maintenance records. The client will receive a targeted list of the safest aircraft to analyze further - for cost, number of seats, fuel efficiency, or other factors outside of the scope of this analysis - before making a final purchasing decision.

# Data Understanding

This project uses two data sources: [accident data](./data/Aviation_Data.csv) and [aircraft registration data](https://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/aircraft_certification/aircraft_registry/releasable_aircraft_download) from the FAA. The accident data, "data.csv", includes a unique entry for each accident or incident recorded, along with the number of injuries, fatalites, etc., information about the aircraft involved, and the circumstances around the event.
